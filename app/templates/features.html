    <h1> Innovation</h1>
    <P>  
        Messaging apps are a great way to share information in direct messages and group
        chats, similar to chat rooms. Team members can send short snippets of information
        back and forth without clogging up their inboxes. Many organizations use video conferencing to help bring together remote teams, but video calls can be just as burdensome to people's schedules as phone
        conferences. Work messaging apps make things simpler with instant, bite-sized
        communication capabilities. Some apps are distracting and hinder work productivity, such as many social media
        apps. However, streamlining project processes and communication in a team
        messaging app can increase productivity and improve time management. Team members can develop task lists and assign action items to coworkers and tag
        them so they get an instant notification, making it easy to track the overall progress
        in any project. Many business apps feature an email integration that lets team leaders receive
        automatic notifications about project progress in customizable intervals.  </P>
        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
            End-to-end encryption is perhaps the most important security feature and data is
            encrypted both in transit and in storage, and only the communicating end users of a
            given chat can access shared messages and information. Even if a chat platform’s
            servers are breached, the data on them is encrypted and thus unreadable by
            unauthorized individuals, which also includes the platform provider itself. That level of encryption is an obvious security measure to implement if we view
            enterprise chat apps as what they truly are: digital meeting rooms filled with
            sensitive business information. After all, no company would allow competitors to eavesdrop on important internal
            meetings. But by not encrypting workplace chats, that’s exactly what they seem to
            be doing—allowing malicious actors the opportunity to steal intellectual property
            and other valuable information.</p>
